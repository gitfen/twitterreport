twitterreport
=============

Out-of-the-box tools for analysis and reporting for twitter

About
-----

This package is an exercise to understad a little bit more how does the Twitter API works. Several functions allow to use the REST API through the `httr` package.

While there are some (very neat) R packages focused on twitter (specifically the package `twitteR` and `stramR`), `twitterreport` is centered in analysis and reporting tools. This package includes functions to extract mentions/hashtags/urls from text, match names with gender, create networks (currently of mentions), extract twitter accounts from a given url; besides of several twitter API tools using the REST API.

You can take a look at a live example here <http://www.its.caltech.edu/~gvegayon/twitter/report_example.html> and the source code for this example here <https://github.com/gvegayon/twitterreport/blob/master/vignettes/report_example.Rmd>

Some of the functions here were firstly originated in the project *nodoschile.cl*, a Chile based SNA consultancy company. You can visit the project <http://nodos.modularity.cl> and the website (part of nodoschile) that motivated `twitterreports` here <http://modularity.cl/presidenciales>.

Installation
------------

While the package is still in development, you can always use `devtools` to install the most recent version.

``` r
devtools::install_git('gvegayon/twitterreport')
```

Examples
--------

### Getting tweets from a set of users

``` r
# Firts, load the package!
library(twitterreport)

# List of twitter accounts
users <- c('MarsRovers', 'senatormenendez', 'sciencemagazine')

# Getting the twitts (first gen the token)
key <- tw_gen_token('myapp','key', 'secret')
tweets <- lapply(users, tw_api_get_statuses_user_timeline, twitter_token=key)
 
# Processing the data (and taking a look)
tweets <- do.call(rbind, tweets)
head(tweets)
```

### Creating a network of mentions

``` r
# First, we need to extract the mentions from the message
contents <- tw_extract(tweets$text)

# Building the network and visualizing it as a D3js graph!
graph <- tw_network(tweets$screen_name, contents$mentions, minInteract=3)
plot(graph)
```

In the following examples we will use data on US senators extracted from twitter using the REST API (you can find it in the package)

### Creating a wordcloud

The function `tw_words` takes a character vector (of tweets for example) and extracts all the stopwords+symbols. And the `plot` method for its output creates a wordcloud

``` r
data(senate_tweets)
tab <- tw_words(senate_tweets$text)

# What did it do?
senate_tweets$text[1:2];tab[1:2]
```

    ## [1] "“I am saddened by the news that four Marines lost their lives today in the service of our country.” #Chattanooga"         
    ## [2] ".@SenAlexander statement on today’s “tragic and senseless” murder of four Marines in #Chattanooga: http://t.co/H9zWdJPbiE"

    ## [[1]]
    ##  [1] "saddened"    "news"        "four"        "marines"     "lost"       
    ##  [6] "lives"       "today"       "service"     "country"     "chattanooga"
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## [1] "senalexander" "statement"    "todays"       "tragic"      
    ## [5] "senseless"    "murder"       "four"         "marines"     
    ## [9] "chattanooga"

``` r
# Plot
plot(tab, max.n.words = 40)
```

### Identifying individuals gender

Using english and spanish names, the `tw_gender` function matches the character argument (which can be a vector) with either a male or female name (or unidentified).

``` r
data(senators_profile)

# Getting the names
sen <- tolower(senators_profile$tw_name)
sen <- gsub('\\bsen(ator|\\.)\\s+','',sen)
sen <- gsub('\\s+.+','',sen)

tab <- table(tw_gender(sen))
barplot(tab)
```
